# Changelog

## 0.1.2 - Operator Control Surface

- Expanded the command palette with boss quick asks, workspace refresh, Ouro-agent refresh, Workbench MCP install/refresh, release-page open, diagnostics reveal/copy/open-folder, and selected-terminal actions.
- Made command palette search token-aware with aliases for operator terms like `diag`, `boss`, `mcp`, `folder`, and `signal`.
- Added explicit terminal `EOF` / Ctrl-D controls, `Command-L` redraw shortcuts, selected-terminal copy/open/reveal commands, and smaller session-header utility buttons.
- Added diagnostics zip path copy, diagnostics output-folder open, action-log entries for native diagnostics/release/terminal-control actions, and stronger diagnostics runner validation.
- Hardened packaged-app preflight by smoke-running the bundled diagnostics helper and verifying the helper is non-empty.

## 0.1.1 - Post-Preview Hardening

- Added explicit terminal `Redraw` controls that send Ctrl-L in pane and focused terminal modes.
- Added command-palette actions for terminal focus, terminal redraw, boss-pane toggle, support diagnostics, and release update checks.
- Added in-app support diagnostics collection and Finder reveal from the native boss dashboard.
- Bundled the support diagnostics helper into the `.app` and made bundle verification reject missing or non-executable diagnostics helpers.
- Updated support diagnostics to run from either a repo checkout or the installed app bundle.
